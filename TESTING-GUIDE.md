# Complete Testing Roadmap for Your Automation Hub

## Phase 1: Foundation Testing (Day 1 - Today)
Test the core workflows that will save the most time immediately.

### Test 1: FreeScout Connection (5 minutes)
```
Test command:
"Show me my 5 most recent FreeScout tickets"
```
✅ Success = List of tickets appears
❌ Fail = Check FreeScout MCP configuration

### Test 2: FreeScout + Stripe Integration (10 minutes)
```
Test command:
"Pick one FreeScout ticket and tell me if that customer has an active Stripe subscription, what tier they're on, and their payment status"
```
✅ Success = Customer data enrichment works
❌ Fail = Check Stripe API permissions

### Test 3: Morning Support Triage (15 minutes)
```
Full command from workflows/daily/morning-triage.md:
"Perform my morning support triage:
1. Use FreeScout to list all active/pending tickets from the last 24 hours
2. For each ticket, check if the customer email exists in Stripe and get their subscription tier
3. Prioritize by subscription value
4. Flag any customers with failed payments
5. Show Agency and Professional customers first with draft responses"
```
✅ Success = Prioritized ticket list with payment context
❌ Fail = Note which step fails for debugging

### Test 4: Payment Recovery (10 minutes)
```
Test command:
"Check Stripe for any failed payments in the last 7 days, and for each one, tell me if they have any open FreeScout tickets"
```
✅ Success = Failed payments correlated with support tickets
❌ Fail = Check date formatting, API limits

## Phase 2: Weekly Workflow Testing (Day 2)

### Test 5: Mastermind Prep (20 minutes)
```
Run on Thursday at 2 PM:
Full command from workflows/weekly/mastermind-prep.md
```
Validate:
- [ ] MRR calculation correct
- [ ] Support metrics accurate
- [ ] At-risk accounts identified
- [ ] Discussion points generated

### Test 6: Gmail Integration (10 minutes)
```
Test command:
"Search my Gmail for any emails mentioning WPML or Sagar in the last 30 days"
```
✅ Success = Relevant emails found
❌ Fail = Check Gmail API scope permissions

### Test 7: Calendar Integration (5 minutes)
```
Test command:
"Show me my calendar events for next week and flag any that might conflict with deep work time"
```
✅ Success = Events listed with analysis
❌ Fail = Check calendar permissions

## Phase 3: Advanced Testing (Day 3)

### Test 8: Tax Compliance (30 minutes)
```
Test with smaller date range first:
"Pull my Stripe revenue for just last week, separated by country, and search Gmail for any receipts from the same period"
```
Then run full quarterly command from workflows/monthly/tax-compliance.md

### Test 9: Partnership Prep (15 minutes)
```
Test with real partner:
"I'm meeting with Sagar from WPML tomorrow. Prepare my partnership intelligence briefing"
```
Validate:
- [ ] Email history found
- [ ] Customer status checked
- [ ] Support tickets analyzed
- [ ] Proposals generated

### Test 10: EchoDash Intelligence (20 minutes)
```
Run the full command from workflows/on-demand/echodash-intelligence.md
```
Look for:
- [ ] Feature requests extracted
- [ ] Competitor mentions found
- [ ] Market gaps identified
- [ ] Priority list created

## Phase 4: Automation Testing (Day 4)

### Test 11: Workflow Chaining
```
Test morning sequence:
1. "Run my payment recovery check"
2. "Now run my morning support triage"
3. "Based on these results, what should I focus on today?"
```
✅ Success = Claude maintains context across commands

### Test 12: Error Handling
```
Test with intentionally wrong data:
"Get FreeScout ticket #999999"
"Check Stripe customer fake@email.com"
```
✅ Success = Graceful error messages
❌ Fail = Note any crashes or unclear errors

### Test 13: Data Export
```
Test command:
"Run my morning support triage and save the results to a file at /Users/jgarturo/Projects/OpenAI/support-report.md"
```
✅ Success = File created with formatted data

## Phase 5: Optimization Testing (Day 5)

### Test 14: Performance Benchmarking
Time each workflow:
- Morning triage: Target < 30 seconds
- Payment recovery: Target < 20 seconds
- Mastermind prep: Target < 60 seconds
- Tax compliance: Target < 2 minutes

### Test 15: Batch Operations
```
Test command:
"For all Agency tier customers in Stripe, check if they have any open FreeScout tickets"
```
Monitor for rate limits or timeouts

## Testing Checklist Template

For each workflow test:

### Pre-Test
- [ ] Required MCPs are connected
- [ ] Test with small data set first
- [ ] Have fallback plan if it fails

### During Test
- [ ] Copy exact command from workflow file
- [ ] Note any error messages
- [ ] Time the execution
- [ ] Screenshot successful outputs

### Post-Test
- [ ] Document what worked
- [ ] Note improvements needed
- [ ] Update workflow file with tips
- [ ] Commit changes to git

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue: "Tool not found"
Fix: Restart Claude Desktop after config changes

### Issue: "API rate limit"
Fix: Add delays or reduce batch sizes

### Issue: "No results found"
Fix: Check date formats, email addresses, search terms

### Issue: "Permission denied"
Fix: Verify API scopes and permissions

### Issue: Timeout
Fix: Reduce date ranges or data requested

## Success Metrics

After complete testing, you should have:
- ✅ 12+ working workflows
- ✅ 20+ hours per week time saved
- ✅ 90% reduction in manual data gathering
- ✅ Confident automation system

## Daily Testing Schedule

**Monday**: Test daily workflows (morning triage, payment recovery)
**Tuesday**: Test weekly workflows (support analytics, revenue reports)
**Wednesday**: Test on-demand workflows (partnership prep, deep work)
**Thursday**: Test mastermind prep (live use case!)
**Friday**: Test monthly workflows (tax, churn analysis)

## Command to Test Everything

```
"Run a complete system check:
1. Verify all MCPs are responding (FreeScout, Stripe, Gmail, Calendar, Cloudflare)
2. Test one simple command for each integration
3. Report which integrations work and which need attention
4. Suggest the highest-impact workflow to run right now based on current time and day"
```

## Your Testing Priority

Start with these HIGH-IMPACT workflows first:
1. **Morning Support Triage** - Saves 40 min/day
2. **Payment Recovery** - Saves $2k/month
3. **Mastermind Prep** - Saves 80 min/week
4. **Tax Compliance** - Saves 9 hours/quarter

These four workflows alone will save you 25+ hours per week!

## Next Steps After Testing

1. Document any custom modifications needed
2. Share successful workflows with Alex
3. Create video/screenshots for future reference
4. Schedule workflows in your calendar
5. Track actual time saved for 1 week
