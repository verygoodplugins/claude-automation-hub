# Code Refactoring Assistant

Refactor $ARGUMENTS following modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices.

## Task

I'll help you refactor code by:

1. Analyzing the current implementation
2. Identifying improvement opportunities
3. Applying modern patterns and practices
4. Maintaining existing functionality
5. Ensuring type safety and test coverage
6. Documenting the changes made

## Process

I'll follow these steps:

1. Examine the code to understand its purpose and structure
2. Identify code smells, anti-patterns, or outdated approaches
3. Plan the refactoring strategy with clear goals
4. Implement changes incrementally while maintaining behavior
5. Verify refactored code with tests
6. Document improvements and benefits

## Refactoring Techniques

I can apply various refactoring techniques:

- Converting to modern JavaScript/TypeScript features
- Improving type definitions and type safety
- Extracting reusable functions and components
- Applying design patterns appropriately
- Converting callbacks to Promises or async/await
- Simplifying complex conditionals and loops
- Removing duplicate code
- Improving naming and readability
- Optimizing performance
- Enhancing error handling

## Modern Practices I Can Apply

- ES modules and import/export syntax
- Optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- Array and object destructuring
- Spread and rest operators
- Template literals
- Arrow functions
- Class fields and private methods
- TypeScript utility types
- Functional programming patterns
- React hooks (for React components)

I'll ensure the refactored code maintains compatibility with your project's requirements while improving quality and maintainability.
