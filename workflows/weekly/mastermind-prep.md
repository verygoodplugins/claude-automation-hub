# Mastermind Prep Intelligence

## Command
```
Prepare my Thursday mastermind briefing (WP Business Mastermind at 4:30 PM):
1. Pull this week's Stripe metrics: Current MRR, week-over-week growth rate, new vs churned customers
2. Identify top 5 at-risk subscriptions (high value customers with failed payments or no login activity)
3. Get support metrics from FreeScout: tickets this week vs last week, average resolution time, most common issues
4. Check my Gmail for any partnership opportunities or important discussions to bring up
5. Review my calendar for any conflicts with next week's mastermind
6. Generate 3 strategic discussion points based on the data trends
7. Format everything for screen sharing during the call
