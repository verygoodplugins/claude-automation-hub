## Related Workflows
- [Morning Routine](./morning-routine.md) - Also supports notifications
- [Weekly Review](../weekly/review-planning.md) - Long-running workflow perfect for mobile alerts
- [Focus Mode](../on-demand/focus-mode.md) - Quick setup with completion ping

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Received
- ✅ Check ntfy app is installed and topic subscribed
- ✅ Verify NTFY_TOPIC environment variable: `echo $NTFY_TOPIC`
- ✅ Test manual notification: `curl -d "test" ntfy.sh/$NTFY_TOPIC`
- ✅ Check phone notification settings for ntfy app
- ✅ Ensure internet connectivity

### Common Issues
- **Topic not found**: Ensure exact topic name match
- **No notifications**: Check environment variable is set
- **Delayed notifications**: Network latency, try different server
- **Authentication errors**: ntfy.sh public topics don't need auth

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export NTFY_TOPIC="claude-automation-hub-alerts-$(whoami)"
# Reload: source ~/.zshrc
```

## Security Considerations
- Use unique, hard-to-guess topic names
- Don't include sensitive data in notifications
- Consider self-hosting ntfy for private use
- Rotate topic names periodically
