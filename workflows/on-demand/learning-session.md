# Learning Session Setup

## Command
```
Set up my optimal learning environment for deep study:
1. Find comprehensive documentation via Context7 for the topic
2. Create structured note-taking directory with Filesystem
3. Generate learning plan with milestones in Apple Reminders
4. Block calendar for focused learning time (Pomodoro sessions)
5. Search Gmail for any relevant courses or resources I've saved
6. Check MCP Memory Service for previous learning on related topics
7. Set up Spotify with focus/study playlist
8. Configure Brave with documentation tabs and tutorial videos
9. Create practice exercise files in project directory
10. Send learning commitment to accountability partner via WhatsApp
```

## Prerequisites
- Context7 MCP (for documentation)
- Filesystem MCP (for notes structure)
- Apple Reminders MCP (for learning plan)
- Google Calendar MCP (for time blocking)
- Gmail MCP (for resource search)
- MCP Memory Service MCP (for knowledge retrieval)
- Spotify MCP (for focus music)
- Brave Browser MCP (for resources)
- WhatsApp MCP (for accountability)

## Frequency
On-demand (when starting new learning topics)

## Time Saved
- Manual setup: 45 minutes
- With automation: 5 minutes
- **Saved: 40 minutes per session**

## Variables You Can Customize
- `TOPIC`: "TypeScript Advanced Patterns"
- `LEARNING_STYLE`: "hands-on" | "theory-first" | "project-based"
- `SESSION_LENGTH`: 90 // minutes
- `POMODORO_INTERVALS`: [25, 5, 25, 5, 25, 15] // work/break pattern
- `DIFFICULTY_LEVEL`: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
- `PRACTICE_PROBLEMS`: 5 // number to generate
- `ACCOUNTABILITY_PARTNER`: "@phone_number"
- `RESOURCE_TYPES`: ["docs", "videos", "tutorials", "examples"]

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Documentation gathered
- ✅ Notes structure created
- ✅ Learning path defined
- ✅ Time blocked
- ✅ Environment optimized
- ✅ Accountability established

```typescript
// TODO: Create a type that makes all properties 
// of User optional except 'id'
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

type PartialUser = // Your solution here

// objects with a 'length' property
function logLength<T>(item: T): void {
  console.log(item.length); // Error: Property 'length' does not exist
}

## Troubleshooting
- Context7 requires exact library/framework names
- Large documentation may need selective retrieval
- Practice problems should match skill level
- Calendar conflicts may need manual resolution
