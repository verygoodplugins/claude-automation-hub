# Deep Work Protection Protocol

## Command
```
Activate deep work mode for [DURATION] hours:
1. Check my calendar and confirm no meetings scheduled during this time
2. Look for any urgent FreeScout tickets from Agency/Professional customers
3. Check Stripe for any payment emergencies requiring immediate attention
4. If all clear, generate my focus briefing:
   - Summary of what to work on (based on calendar event description)
   - Any context needed from recent emails
   - Set reminder for 5 minutes before deep work ends
5. Create end-of-session check-in prompt for when I return
```

## Prerequisites
- Google Calendar (schedule check)
- FreeScout (urgent ticket check)
- Stripe (payment emergency check)
- Gmail (context gathering)

## Frequency

## Variables
