# Partnership Meeting Intelligence

## Command
```
I'm meeting with [PARTNER_NAME] tomorrow. Prepare my partnership intelligence briefing:
1. Search all Gmail conversations with this partner/company, summarize our history
2. Identify any unresolved items or pending commitments from previous discussions
3. Check if they're a WP Fusion customer in Stripe (and their subscription details)
4. Search FreeScout for any support tickets from their domain
5. Look for their company mentions in recent support tickets (integration issues?)
6. Research their product's overlap with WP Fusion features
7. Generate 3 win-win collaboration proposals based on mutual customer benefit
8. Create negotiation talking points based on our relative positions
9. Identify what they likely want from us vs what we want from them
10. Suggest specific technical integration opportunities
