# FreeScout Issue Implementation Workflow

## Command
```
Implement a complete fix for FreeScout ticket:
1. Get the ticket details using freescout_get_ticket with the ticket URL/ID
2. Analyze the issue using freescout_analyze_ticket to understand root cause
3. Check freescout_get_ticket_context for customer history and patterns
4. Create a Git worktree using git_create_worktree for isolated development
5. Search project files using Filesystem for relevant code sections
6. Look up documentation with Context7 for any frameworks involved
7. Implement the fix and test locally
8. Create a pull request using github_create_pr with ticket reference
9. Draft a customer reply using freescout_create_draft_reply
10. Add internal notes with freescout_add_note for team visibility
11. Update ticket status using freescout_update_ticket
12. Store solution pattern in OpenMemory for future reference
```

📝 CUSTOMER DRAFT CREATED
"Hi Sarah,

Great news! We've identified and fixed the webhook issue you reported.

The problem was with how our system validated nested user properties 
in the webhook payload. We've updated the validation logic and added 
specific handling for user update events.

The fix has been deployed to our staging environment for testing. 
Could you please test your webhook endpoint with our staging URL:
https://staging.api.example.com/webhooks

Once you confirm it's working, we'll deploy to production immediately.

We've also added additional monitoring to prevent similar issues in 
the future. Thank you for your patience and for helping us improve 
our platform!

Best regards,
Support Team"

📝 INTERNAL NOTE ADDED
"Root cause: Validation schema didn't account for nested user.profile 
objects. Fixed in PR #456. Similar validation issues might exist in 
other webhook types - created follow-up ticket #235 to audit all 
webhook validators."

🎯 TICKET UPDATED
• Status: Changed to "Pending Customer"
• Assigned: Development Team → Support Team
• Tags: Added "webhook", "fixed-in-staging"

💾 KNOWLEDGE SAVED
Pattern stored: "Webhook validation for nested objects"

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Git repository has worktree support enabled
- FreeScout API needs appropriate permissions
- Large tickets may need content truncation
- Context7 requires matching library names
