# Workflow Discovery Generator

## Master Command - Find New Automation Opportunities
```
Analyze my current MCP integrations and suggest 5 new workflow combinations I haven't implemented yet:

Available MCPs:
- FreeScout (support tickets)
- Stripe (payments, subscriptions, customers)
- Cloudflare (KV storage, R2 storage, D1 database, Workers)
- Gmail (email search, analysis)
- Google Calendar (events, scheduling)
- Filesystem (local file operations)
- Spotify (music control)
- Brave Browser (web automation)

Consider:
1. Workflows that combine 2+ tools for multiplicative value
2. Time-based triggers I haven't utilized
3. Data flows between systems
4. Predictive/preventive automations
5. Team collaboration improvements

For each suggestion, provide:
- Workflow name
- Tools required
- Command to run
- Time saved estimate
- Business impact
```

## Discovered Workflows Queue

### Not Yet Implemented (High Value)

1. **Customer Journey Tracker**
```
Combine FreeScout + Stripe + Gmail to create complete customer timeline:
Show me everything about [customer email]: support tickets, payment history, email exchanges, lifetime value, and suggested next actions
```

2. **Proactive Churn Prevention**
```
Daily scan: Find Stripe customers whose usage dropped 50%+ in last 30 days, check if they've opened support tickets, and draft personalized retention email
```

3. **Conference Intelligence**
```
When I add a conference to Calendar, search Gmail for attendee list, check who's a customer (Stripe), prep talking points for each person I'll meet
```

4. **Support Pattern Detector**
```
Weekly: Analyze all FreeScout tickets, identify sudden spike in specific issue, check if it correlates with recent Cloudflare Worker deployment, alert if pattern detected
```

5. **Revenue Weather Report**
```
Every Monday: Combine Stripe trends + Calendar (upcoming renewals) + FreeScout (support sentiment) to predict next month's revenue with confidence score
```

### Experimental (Cutting Edge)

6. **Auto-Documentation from Support**
```
When 3+ tickets ask same question, generate documentation draft, store in Cloudflare R2, and link in future responses
```

7. **Smart Day Optimizer**
```
Look at my Calendar, check FreeScout ticket urgency, analyze Stripe for any payment emergencies, then recommend optimal schedule for today
```

8. **Relationship Manager**
```
Track email frequency with partners/customers (Gmail), note last interaction, suggest who to reconnect with based on value and time elapsed
```

9. **Deployment Impact Analyzer**
```
After each Cloudflare Worker deployment, monitor FreeScout for related issues, Stripe for payment failures, and create impact report
```

10. **Focus Mode Automation**
```
When Calendar shows "Deep Work", close Brave tabs, start Spotify focus playlist, set FreeScout to auto-respond, batch non-urgent emails
```

## Tool Combination Multipliers
