- **Application-specific rules** - Different behavior for different apps
- **Performance boost** - Faster window navigation and management

## Performance Impact

Many users report significant productivity improvements:
- **Faster window navigation** - Jump between windows instantly with keyboard shortcuts
- **Better screen utilization** - Automatic tiling maximizes usable space
- **Reduced context switching** - Less time spent arranging windows manually
- **Improved focus** - Dedicated spaces for different types of work

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install yabai and skhd via Homebrew
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd

# Start services
brew services start yabai
brew services start skhd
```

### 2. Configure System Permissions

Yabai requires accessibility permissions:

1. **System Preferences** ‚Üí **Security & Privacy** ‚Üí **Privacy** ‚Üí **Accessibility**
2. Add and enable both `yabai` and `skhd`
3. You may need to restart the services after granting permissions

### 3. Install Configuration

Choose one of the example configurations:

```bash
# Copy your development-optimized config
cp config/yabai/yabairc-example.sh ~/.config/yabai/yabairc
cp config/yabai/skhdrc-example.sh ~/.config/skhd/skhdrc

# OR copy the minimal config for beginners
cp config/yabai/yabairc-minimal.sh ~/.config/yabai/yabairc
cp config/yabai/skhdrc-popular.sh ~/.config/skhd/skhdrc

# Make yabairc executable
chmod +x ~/.config/yabai/yabairc

# Restart services to apply changes
brew services restart yabai
brew services restart skhd
```

### 4. Optional: Scripting Addition (Advanced)

For advanced features like window opacity and borders:

```bash
# Install scripting addition (requires SIP to be partially disabled)
sudo yabai --install-sa

# Load scripting addition
sudo yabai --load-sa
```

**Note:** This requires disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP) partially. See [yabai documentation](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection) for details.
