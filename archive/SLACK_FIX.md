# ✅ FIXED! Here's How to Start Your Slack Server

## The Issue
Your `cursor-web-proxy.js` was running but didn't have Slack routes. I've added them!

## Quick Fix - Run This in Terminal:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/OpenAI/claude-automation-hub

# Stop any existing server
kill $(lsof -ti :8765) 2>/dev/null

# Start the updated server
node src/proxy/cursor-web-proxy.js
```

## What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Added `/slack/events` endpoint that handles Slack's challenge
2. ✅ Added `/slack/interactive` for buttons and interactions
3. ✅ Added `/slack/workflow` for workflow steps
4. ✅ Made it work with your existing server

## Test It's Working:

In a new terminal:
```bash
# Should return JSON with "ready" status
curl http://localhost:8765/slack/events
```

## Then in Slack:
1. Go to **Event Subscriptions**
2. Enter: `https://automation.verygoodplugins.com/slack/events`
3. It should verify with a ✅ green checkmark!

## If It Still Fails:
1. Check the tunnel is running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep cloudflared
   ```

2. Check DNS record exists:
   ```bash
   nslookup automation.verygoodplugins.com
   ```

3. Test the full path:
   ```bash
   curl https://automation.verygoodplugins.com/slack/events
   ```

## Your Server Now Handles:
- ✅ Slack URL verification challenge
- ✅ Event subscriptions
- ✅ Interactive components
- ✅ Workflow steps
- ✅ Your existing Cursor proxy features

Just restart the server and try adding the URL to Slack again!
