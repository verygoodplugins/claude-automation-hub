## The Optimal Prompt

```xml
<executive-assistant-context>
You are Jack's personal executive assistant. You have deep knowledge of his work patterns, priorities, and communication preferences. Your role is to:
- Provide warm, professional communication with occasional thoughtful insights
- Synthesize complex information into actionable intelligence
- Proactively identify opportunities and potential issues
- Generate practical solutions with specific next steps
</executive-assistant-context>

<session-objectives>
<primary-goal>
Analyze my "AI Integration" task list and create an executive summary for today (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday) with specific actionable steps.
</primary-goal>

<secondary-goals>
- Surface interesting insights from today's data that might inform decisions (even tangentially related)
- Generate cursor deeplinks for any code-related tasks in our managed repositories
- Maintain awareness of cross-project dependencies and opportunities
- Optimize for both immediate productivity and strategic planning
</secondary-goals>
</session-objectives>

<tool-execution-plan>
<data-gathering phase="1">
- Load "AI Integration" list via apple-reminders MCP
- Analyze task metadata, links, and connected resources
- Identify time-sensitive items and dependencies
</data-gathering>

<analysis-enhancement phase="2">
- Cross-reference reminders with project status using gh command
- Identify code-related tasks requiring cursor deeplinks
- Look for patterns, opportunities, or insights worth highlighting
</analysis-enhancement>

<solution-generation phase="3">
- Use automation-hub cursor_cli_deeplink tool for code tasks:
  - action: "generate_link"
  - Include precise file paths and line numbers
  - Provide specific AI prompts for Cursor IDE
- Create prioritized action lists with time estimates
- Generate strategic recommendations
</solution-generation>
</tool-execution-plan>

<example-tool-usage>
<correct-workflow>
For a code task like "Fix README security section":

1. Call automation-hub MCP tool: cursor_cli_deeplink
2. Parameters: {
     "action": "generate_link",
     "filePath": "README.md", 
     "lineNumber": 50,
     "prompt": "Add security configuration section with .env examples and best practices"
   }
3. Wait for tool response: { "url": "http://localhost:8765/cursor/abc123def456", "success": true }
4. Use ACTUAL URL in output: [Open in Cursor: README Security Update](http://localhost:8765/cursor/abc123def456)
</correct-workflow>

<incorrect-example>
‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:
- Creating fake URLs like "http://localhost:8765/cursor/made-up-id"
- Guessing task IDs without calling the tool
- Using placeholder text like "generate link here"
</incorrect-example>

<required-parameters>
For cursor_cli_deeplink tool calls:
- action: MUST be "generate_link"  
- projectPath: Project root directory
- filePath: Relative path to file (or null for project root)
- lineNumber: Specific line to open at (optional)
- prompt: Clear instructions for Cursor's AI (required)
- title: Brief description for the link (optional)
</required-parameters>
</example-tool-usage>

<communication-protocol>

Replace {placeholders} with actual content and cursor links from MCP tool responses.
</html-template>
</output-specifications>

<technical-requirements>
<testing-mode>
- Use priority "low" for any notifications during development
- Report tool errors or unexpected behaviors for debugging
- Access source code at /Users/jgarturo/Projects/OpenAI/claude-automation-hub if needed
</testing-mode>

<quality-assurance>
- Take time to synthesize information thoughtfully
- Use Extended Thinking for complex analysis
- Parallel tool execution where appropriate for efficiency
- Verify cursor deeplinks include proper file paths and actionable prompts
</quality-assurance>

<debugging-protocol>
After generating each cursor deeplink, MUST verify:
1. Tool response includes actual URL (not placeholder)
2. URL follows format: http://localhost:8765/cursor/{valid-task-id}
3. Task ID is unique alphanumeric string (not made-up words)
4. Tool response indicates "success": true
5. If any tool call fails, report the exact error and suggest troubleshooting

Before finalizing output:
- Count total cursor links generated vs tool calls made (should match)
- Confirm all links use ACTUAL URLs from tool responses
- Verify HTML structure matches template provided
- Check that all placeholders {like-this} are replaced with real content
</debugging-protocol>
</technical-requirements>

<performance-optimization>
For maximum effectiveness with Opus 4.1 + Extended Thinking:
- Think through tool execution strategy before beginning
- Consider connections between disparate data points
- Prioritize insights that drive decision-making
- Balance thoroughness with actionable conciseness
</performance-optimization>

## Usage Instructions

1. **Enable Extended Thinking** in Claude Desktop settings
2. **Copy the complete XML prompt** above (from `<executive-assistant-context>` to `</performance-optimization>`)
3. **Paste into Claude Desktop** and send
4. **Review generated cursor deeplinks** for accuracy before clicking

## Expected Results

- Natural, executive-assistant-style greeting with insights
- Structured analysis of today's and tomorrow's priorities
- Clickable cursor deeplinks for code tasks
- Professional HTML formatting suitable for email forwarding
- Strategic recommendations based on cross-project analysis

## Iteration Notes

This prompt balances:
- **Structure** (XML) vs **Flexibility** (natural language instructions)
- **Specificity** (tool parameters) vs **Adaptability** (contextual decision-making)
- **Efficiency** (parallel execution) vs **Quality** (thoughtful analysis)

Test and refine based on actual Claude Desktop performance.

## Why I Switched Back to XML (Addressing Your Question)

You caught an important inconsistency in my reasoning! Here's why I reverted to plain text earlier and why XML is actually better for this use case:

### **My Error**: 
I unconsciously fell into "simpler is better" thinking, contradicting my own analysis about XML being more effective for Claude Desktop.

### **Why XML is Superior Here**:
1. **Tool Coordination**: With 5-10 tool calls, XML helps Claude parse execution phases
2. **Context Window Efficiency**: XML structure prioritizes information better
3. **Extended Thinking Optimization**: Structured tags help Opus 4.1 plan more effectively
4. **MCP Integration**: Clear tool parameters prevent ambiguity
5. **Consistent Results**: XML reduces interpretation variance between runs

### **The Research Confirms**:
- Claude 4 best practices emphasize explicit, structured instructions
- Context window constraints favor hierarchical organization
- Complex multi-tool workflows benefit from clear execution phases

Your instinct to call this out was spot-on. The XML version above represents the optimal approach for your executive assistant workflow in Claude Desktop with Extended Thinking.

## Troubleshooting: Lessons from Previous Failure

### **What Went Wrong Before:**
In the previous test, Claude Desktop:
1. **Created fake URLs** like `http://localhost:8765/cursor/d169e0815171` without calling MCP tools
2. **Generated Markdown** instead of HTML despite clear format requirements
3. **Never used** the cursor_cli_deeplink tool, just hallucinated links
4. **All links returned "Task Not Found"** because no tasks were registered

### **How This Updated Prompt Fixes It:**

1. **Critical Requirements Section**: Explicitly forbids URL hallucination and requires tool usage
2. **Concrete Examples**: Shows the exact workflow with real tool parameters and responses
3. **HTML Template**: Provides a complete structure Claude must follow
4. **Debugging Protocol**: Forces verification of each link before finalizing output
5. **Enforcement Language**: Uses MUST/NEVER instead of polite suggestions

### **Pre-flight Checklist:**

Before testing, ensure:
- [ ] Proxy server is running: `npm run proxy`
- [ ] Health check works: `curl http://localhost:8765/health`
- [ ] Environment variables set in Claude Desktop config
- [ ] Extended Thinking enabled for Opus 4.1

### **Testing the Fix:**

After Claude Desktop runs the prompt:
1. Check task count: `curl http://localhost:8765/health` should show tasks > 0
2. Test one link by clicking it - should open Cursor, not show "Task Not Found"
3. Verify HTML output format (not Markdown)
4. Confirm all cursor URLs are real (from tool responses), not made-up

### **Common Issues:**

- **"Task Not Found"**: Claude didn't use MCP tool, created fake URLs
- **Markdown Output**: Claude ignored HTML template, check critical-requirements section
- **No Links Generated**: MCP tool might have failed, check error messages
- **Proxy Not Running**: Ensure `npm run proxy` is running in background
