# Claude Automation Hub ü§ñ

**Transform your daily tasks into automated workflows using Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor IDE**

## About This Project

Hi! I'm Jack Arturo, founder of [Very Good Plugins](https://verygoodplugins.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ai-automation-hub). We're the team behind [WP Fusion](https://wpfusion.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ai-automation-hub), and we've spent years helping businesses automate their WordPress workflows.

**But here's the thing:** We believe the best tools should be free and accessible to everyone.

That's why we're sharing everything we've learned about AI automation - the exact workflows that save us 60+ hours every month. No gatekeeping, no "premium" versions, just practical automation that actually works.

> "We're living proof that a small team with some questionable ideas and too much caffeine can build something that actually works." - From our [blog post about replacing $2,000/month in SaaS tools](https://wpfusion.com/business/we-built-4-tools-to-fix-our-support-pipeline-and-you-can-have-them-for-free/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ai-automation-hub)

## What You'll Get üéØ

- **Save 10+ hours per week** with automated workflows
- **Pre-built workflows** for common tasks (morning routine, weekly reviews, reports)
- **Simple copy-paste commands** that work immediately
- **No coding required** - just configuration files and natural language

## Quick Start (15 minutes) ‚ö°

### Step 1: Install Claude Desktop
Download [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) - your AI assistant that can connect to external tools.

### Step 2: Choose Your Tools (MCPs)
MCPs (Model Context Protocol servers) let Claude interact with your favorite services. Pick 2-3 to start:

**Recommended Starter Pack:**
- üìß **[Gmail](https://github.com/crosshatch/gmail-mcp)** - Manage emails and search messages
- üìÖ **[Google Calendar](https://github.com/crosshatch/calendar-mcp)** - Check schedule and create events  
- üìù **[Apple Notes](https://github.com/crosshatch/apple-mcp)** - Create and search notes
- üíæ **[Filesystem](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/filesystem)** - Read and write local files

### Step 3: Configure Your Tools
1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config/claude_desktop_config-example.json ~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. Edit the file and add your chosen MCPs. Here's a minimal example:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "filesystem": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "~/Documents"]
       },
       "gmail": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@crosshatch/gmail-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "GMAIL_OAUTH_EMAIL": "your-email@gmail.com"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

### Step 4: Try Your First Workflow
Open Claude Desktop and paste this command:

```
Create my morning briefing:
1. Check my Gmail for any emails from the last 12 hours
2. Look at my calendar for today's meetings
3. Create a summary with key priorities
4. Save it as a markdown file on my desktop
```

**That's it!** Claude will execute each step and create your morning briefing. üéâ

## Pre-Built Workflows üìö

We've included 20+ tested workflows that save hours every week. Each workflow is a simple markdown file with copy-paste commands.

### Daily Workflows (Save 2+ hours/day)
- **[Morning Routine](workflows/daily/morning-routine.md)** - Start your day with automated email triage, calendar review, and priority setting
- **[End of Day Shutdown](workflows/daily/end-of-day-shutdown.md)** - Wrap up tasks, prepare tomorrow's schedule, send status updates

### Weekly Workflows (Save 5+ hours/week)
- **[Weekly Review](workflows/weekly/review-planning.md)** - Analyze your week's accomplishments and plan ahead
- **[Meeting Prep](workflows/on-demand/meeting-preparation.md)** - Research attendees, gather context, create agendas

### On-Demand Workflows
- **[Focus Mode](workflows/on-demand/focus-mode.md)** - Block distractions and optimize your environment
- **[Project Initialization](workflows/on-demand/project-initialization.md)** - Set up new projects with proper structure
- **[Customer Research](workflows/on-demand/customer-communication-hub.md)** - Aggregate customer interactions across channels

## How Workflows Work üîß

Each workflow is just a markdown file with:
1. **A command to paste** into Claude Desktop
2. **Required MCPs** (the tools Claude needs)
3. **Time saved** (measured from real usage)
4. **Variables you can customize**

Example from [Morning Routine](workflows/daily/morning-routine.md):
```markdown
## Command
Check my Gmail inbox, summarize important emails, 
check calendar for today, create a priority list

## Prerequisites
- Gmail MCP
- Calendar MCP
- Filesystem MCP

## Time Saved
Manual: 30 minutes ‚Üí Automated: 2 minutes
```

## Creating Your Own Workflows ‚ú®

1. **Identify a repetitive task** you do regularly
2. **List the steps** you take manually
3. **Note which tools** you use (email, calendar, files, etc.)
4. **Write a natural language command** describing the process
5. **Test in Claude Desktop** and refine

Use our helper script to create a new workflow:
```bash
./scripts/add-workflow.sh daily "expense-report" "Generate weekly expense report from receipts"
```

## Scheduling Workflows (Optional) ‚è∞

Want workflows to run automatically? Add scheduling to any workflow:

1. **Install the scheduler** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run setup:scheduler
   ```

2. **Configure schedules** in `src/scheduler/workflow-scheduler.js`:
   ```javascript
   schedules: [
     { 
       name: 'morning-routine',
       time: '07:00',
       days: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri']
     }
   ]
   ```

3. **Run the scheduler**:
   ```bash
   npm run scheduler
   ```

Your workflows will now run automatically at the specified times!
